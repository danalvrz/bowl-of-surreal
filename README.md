# bowl-of-surreal
Bowl-of-surreal is a fun little treat to enjoy while having a bowl of cereal in the morning. It was possible thanks to the [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/), and will pour you a colorful bowl of artworks to explore. Each item got a [HSL color code](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp) assigned by the intitute as part the piece&apos;s details, which was used to add color to the this UI. The design was inspired by [Nelson Sakwa's Ballhead App](https://www.behance.net/gallery/31579789/Ballhead-App-%28Free-PSDs%29).

Please enjoy!
